# MyStaking Solidity Smart Contract

## Overview

The MyStaking contract is a Solidity smart contract designed for staking tokens and earning rewards over a specified duration. This project uses Remix IDE for development and deployment.

## Features

- Users can stake tokens for a specific duration.
- Rewards are calculated based on the staking duration.
- Stakers can unstake their tokens and receive both the staked amount and rewards.

## Usage

1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

2. Create a new file in Remix IDE and copy-paste the contents of `MyStaking.sol` into the editor.

3. Compile the contract using the "Solidity Compiler" tab.

4. Deploy the contract using the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.

   - Select the correct contract from the dropdown.
   - Connect to a wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
   - Click "Deploy."

5. Interact with your deployed contract through the "Deployed Contracts" tab.
